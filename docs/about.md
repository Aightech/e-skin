# About the Soft e-Skin Project

Our **Soft e-Skin** initiative explores how bioinspired layered sensors—mimicking the human skin’s multiple layers and multimodal receptors—can be applied to robotics and beyond. By embedding force-sensing and vibration-sensing devices in silicone, we seek to develop robust, adaptable tactile sensors suited for a wide range of applications.

We believe in:
- **Open collaboration** – sharing ideas, data, and designs.
- **Ease of replication** – using off-the-shelf components and straightforward fabrication.
- **Future-proof design** – ensuring our approach scales up to larger areas and higher sensor densities.

## Meet the Team

- **A. W. M. Devillard** – Lead design of silicone encapsulation and FSR layers.
- **A. Dutta** – Electronics and embedded systems architect.
- **Z. Zhang** – Data processing, including neural networks for force/vibration analysis.
- **X. Cheng** – Materials specialist and sensor fabrication advisor.
- **M. Kaboli** – Industrial applications and integration with commercial robotics.
- **E. Burdet** – Principal investigator, overseeing overall system design and research direction.

## Our Vision

1. **Enhanced Haptic Intelligence**  
   We aim to enable robots and prostheses with skin-like sensing, providing advanced interaction awareness for safer, more dextrous manipulation.

2. **Customisable Layers**  
   Different thicknesses, materials, or sensor arrays can be easily swapped in or out, broadening the e-skin’s utility in varied tasks (medical, exploratory, industrial, etc.).

3. **Multimodal Research**  
   Beyond forces and vibrations, future expansions may include temperature, proximity, or chemical sensors—pushing the boundaries of what “electronic skin” can detect.
